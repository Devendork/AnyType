AnyType
=============

This contains the AnyType android application project. It currently only runs on the Asus Transformer Prime tablet. 
The code in this repository is only for the "photo" version of the application. I plan to merge the photo and video 
versions of the application into this single repository for the sake of streamlining and making update to the video 
version of the next few weeks.

Tried to fix the repositories which had some serious mismatching issues. The code I uploaded at this stage turned out to 
be old buggy code that I had previously fixed

Finally took some time to fix the project and make sure all current the most up to date code is in these files and working.
I added a few comments to the classes to make things clearer.

Got the video fully integrated with the photo version. The video is playing back much cleaner than it was in previous versions but I have some bug fixing to do as far as switching between playing letters on the canvas. Also, the thread that is saving out the video frames tends to take its sweet time so I might look to speeding that up as well for the future.

Future
I plan to merge the video back into this repository for streamlining the application (don't ask me why I ever 
separated the two...ugh). After video is added back, I will eventually delete the AnyType-Video repository
