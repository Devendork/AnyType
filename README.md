AnyType
=============

This contains the AnyType android application project. It currently only runs on the Asus Transformer Prime tablet. 
The code in this repository is only for the "photo" version of the application. I plan to merge the photo and video 
versions of the application into this single repository for the sake of streamlining and making update to the video 
version of the next few weeks. 

Upates
=============
1-4-13
Tried to fix the repositories which had some serious mismatching issues. The code I uploaded at this stage turned out to 
be old buggy code that I had previously fixed

2-14-13
Finally took some time to fix the project and make sure all current the most up to date code is in these files and working.
I added a few comments to the classes to make things clearer.

Future
I plan to merge the video back into this repository for streamlining the application (don't ask me why I ever 
separated the two...ugh). After video is added back, I will eventually delete the AnyType-Video repository
